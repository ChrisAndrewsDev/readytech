# Toy Robot Sim or: How to stop that robot from falling off the edge!

## Written with a functional React approach - by Chris Andrews

1. You will need to install the node modules using `yarn install` or `npm install`
2. The default position of the robot is 0, 0, NORTH
3. I was toying (get it?) with the idea of adding a text input area to specify the 'place' x, y and facing- but decided against this as it was not mentioned in the brief
4. I have added some live user updates of location
5. The robot cannot go over the edge! You will receive a visual warning
6. You cannot move until the robot has been placed


------

 This was a surprisingly challenging little scenario, not having worked with esoteric grids and x, y positions that often - it allowed me to use some switch cases which was like dusting off an old, beloved book I hadn't read in ages.


Truth be told, I had some challenges with overall code efficiency and wanting to add more UX/UI but I tried to restrict myself to adherence to the brief.
